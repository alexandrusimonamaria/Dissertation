The source code provides a demonstration of how SMPC can be applied in big data environments, even it is not fully implemented, along with an implementation of K-anonymity and L-diversity to evaluate re-identification risk on a dataset. 
The big data environments is also simulated using the PySpark library, while PySyft is used for SMPC.
All experiments were carried out in Google Colab.
